# UNN-News-Theme
Starting from a simple HTML theme to be a universal theme for multiple platforms.

Started from:
Skeleton https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton (move to https://github.com/Selekkt/skelet)
Hugo Netlify https://github.com/netlify-templates/one-click-hugo-cms

Need to update Gulp. Been running Sass right from the scss folder with: 
sass style.scss:../css/style.css --watch --style compressed
