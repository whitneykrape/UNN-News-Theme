{{!--
	Static block that creates a canvas for a 3D element to be loaded.
	It will include an if that either, loads a default APP and JSON to just display the block,
	create a partial JS that could be loaded? (That might take quite a bit of time...)
	Or do nothing and expect the user to add the app and json pieces themselves. Most likely to be used really. Not everything can be perfectly built from the template right away.

<div class="sceneContainer">
	<canvas></canvas>
	<div id="gizmo-orbit"></div>
</div>

{{!-- Load in place.
	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.module.min.js"></script>
	Pretty sure the module one is preferred at this point.

{{!-- Create for later.
